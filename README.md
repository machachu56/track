# Modifications of this fork

- Fixed endpoints (SOL price check, ETH RPC) Others are not tested
- Avoids Ratelimit to public RPC (Solana)
- Added commands:
  - Blacklist a token:
    - /blacklist TOKEN_ADDR
  - Removes a token from blacklist:
    - /rmblacklist TOKEN_ADDR
  - Lists blacklisted tokens:
    - /lsblacklist
**THESE COMMANDS CAN ONLY BE USED WHILE SENDING A DIRECT MESSAGE TO THE BOT - THEY CANNOT BE USED IN THE GROUP CHAT**

## Installation
To run:
1. Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`, put your Telegram token and chat id there.
3. Rename wallets.json.example to wallets.json, add the wallets to track like this:
```json
{
    "Wallet Name 1": "0x123...",  # EVM address - Program will categorize addresses automatically.
    "Wallet Name 2": "ABC..."     # Solana address - Program will categorize addresses automatically.
}
```
4. (Optional) - Add custom RPC URLs for production use, they can be edited in `config.py`
5. Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```
